# Gas Optimization Patterns in Move

This repository contains gas optimization patterns for the Move language on the Aptos blockchain. The sample smart contracts are in the `source/` folder. They have been formatted in such a way to be compatible with Aptos.

To experiment with the smart contracts on Aptos, clone this repository and clone the `aptos-core` repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Veneris-Group/Move-Gas-Optimization-Patterns.git
git clone https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core
```

Copy this repository into `aptos-core/aptos-move/move-examples/`

Then follow [this](https://aptos.dev/tutorials/first-move-module/) tutorial in order to publish each of the modules. Once this is done, you can run each entry-point function. The command needed to run each function is given in the code above the function.
