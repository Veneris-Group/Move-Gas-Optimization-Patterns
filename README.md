# Gas Optimization Patterns in Move

This repository contains gas optimization patterns for the Move language on the Aptos blockchain. To experiment with the smart contracts, clone this repository and clone the aptos-core repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Veneris-Group/Move-Gas-Optimization-Patterns.git
git clone https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core
```

Copy this repository into `aptos-core/aptos-move/move-examples/`

Then follow [this](https://aptos.dev/tutorials/first-move-module/) tutorial in order to publish each of the modules. Once this is done, you can run each entry-point function. The command needed to run each function is given in the code above the function.
